## THE WORKING BRANCH IS CURRENTLY: 

# --> MASTER <--



### The kie-tests repository

Repository for tests involving multiple projects as well as tests that might not fit into specific
modules. Please feel free to add any tests!

In particular, this has become Marco's private repository for developing remote API integration
tests. Until the Remote API is good and stable (and it's almost there -- but not quite), Marco 
needs this repository to easily and quickly test issues and develop code.
